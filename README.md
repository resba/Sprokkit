Sprokkit is a basic IRC Bot written in Python and cleverly implemented using socket.socket()

The Bot requires no additional libraries unless you want it to.

Additionaly, the bot only has two commands: !test and ^test. So you'll have to add commands as you see fit

for an example of a fully loaded Sprokkit-based Bot, check out Wikkit [https://www.github.com/resba/Wikkit]
